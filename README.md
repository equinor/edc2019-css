# Styling components ðŸ’… â€“ a CSS crash course

**EDC 2019 CSS**

In preparations for the workshop you should install the following:

- Node.js (latest)
- A Git client
- Chrome (latest)
- VS Code (out-of-the-box without third-party extensions)

No prior CSS knowledge required.

In this workshop we'll go through some fundamental concepts in CSS and look at different strategies for styling components. Weâ€™re going to create an alert-component with four variants â€“ info, error, warning and success â€“ first using a BEM-like naming convention, then using functional/atomic css and lastly using Styled Components â€“ a CSS-in-JS library commonly used to style React components. The finished result can be viewed at <https://equinor.github.io/edc2019-css/>.
