# Styling components – a CSS crash course

**EDC 2019 CSS**

In preparations for the workshop you should install the following:

- Node.js (latest)
- A Git client
- Chrome (latest)
- VS Code (out-of-the-box without third-party extensions)

No prior CSS knowledge required.

In this workshop we'll go through some fundamental concepts in CSS and look at different strategies for styling components. We’re going to create an alert-component with four variants – info, error, warning and success – fist using a BEM-like naming convention, then using functional/atomic css and lastly using Styled Components – a CSS-in-JS library commonly used to style React components. The finished result can be viewed at <https://equinor.github.io/edc2019-css/>.
